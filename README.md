====================

You will skin 3 project gutenberg stories with custom CSS.

Modifications to the gutenberg HTML files:
1. Took out the css in document styling and replaced it with <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">.
2. for each of the 3 gutenberg files, I added an image and the image captions.
ie.<img src="images/Alice_in_Wonderland_2_40422.jpg">
